ascii-art-color

This project has some optional side tasks included which stem from my previous ascii-art project.

You will be able to colourise the text output as you wish in a variety of ways, the colours available are black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan and orange.


1. run programme with "go run . --color=<color> "something"

   for example to color your string red run commmand 

   go run . --color=red "your string"


2. you can also add which individual characters you want to be coloured by their place in the string 

   for example to color your string red on only characters 1 3 5 run the command

   go run . --color=red "1 3 5" "your string"


3. you can also choose to color a range of characters 

   for example to color your string red from character number 3 - 7 run the command 

   go run . --color=red "3-7" "your string"


As covered in another of the optional tasks for the ascii-art main project you can also choose to specify your art work to be printed in one of three fonts.
As a final argument in the command line you can choose the fonts "shadow', "standard" and "thinkertoy".

Enjoy!
